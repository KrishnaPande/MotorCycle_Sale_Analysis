Some brands (like Bajaj and Kawasaki) show negative price slopes, indicating heavy depreciation.
Certain motorcycles (e.g., Hero, Yamaha) have higher mileage slopes, meaning better mileage contributes positively to resale value.
Higher mileage_range values are associated with lower depreciation, likely because fuel efficiency is a major selling point.
