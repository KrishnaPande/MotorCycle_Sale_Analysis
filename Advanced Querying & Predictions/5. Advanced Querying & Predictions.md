### 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Can we predict the expected resale price of a bike based on brand, mileage, and owner type?
```sql
SELECT 	ms.brand, 
		"Owner Type", 
		width_bucket(ms."Mileage (km/l)" , 10, 60, 5) AS mileage_range, 
       	AVG("Resale Price (INR)") AS expected_resale_price
FROM motorcycle_sales ms
GROUP BY ms.brand, "Owner Type", mileage_range
ORDER BY ms.brand, mileage_range;
```

**width_bucket** is a function in SQL (available in PostgreSQL and some other databases) that categorizes numerical values into predefined buckets (ranges). It helps in binning continuous data into discrete groups.

`width_bucket(value, min_value, max_value, num_buckets)`

* **value**: The column or expression to categorize.
* **min_value**: The minimum boundary of the range.
* **max_value**: The maximum boundary of the range.
* **num_buckets**: The number of equal-width bins.

```sql
SELECT 
        ms.brand,
        ms."Owner Type", 
        width_bucket(ms."Mileage (km/l)", 10, 60, 5) AS mileage_range,
        regr_slope(ms."Resale Price (INR)", ms."Price (INR)") AS price_slope,
        regr_intercept(ms."Resale Price (INR)", ms."Price (INR)") AS price_intercept,
        regr_slope(ms."Resale Price (INR)", ms."Mileage (km/l)") AS mileage_slope,
        regr_intercept(ms."Resale Price (INR)", ms."Mileage (km/l)") AS mileage_intercept
FROM motorcycle_sales ms
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```

##### **Grouping Criteria:**

* The data is grouped by brand, Owner Type, and mileage_range (which categorizes mileage into five buckets from 10 km/l to 60 km/l).

##### **Regression Analysis:**

* price_slope and price_intercept: Represent how the resale price changes relative to the original price. A positive slope means resale value increases with the original price, while a negative slope suggests depreciation.
* mileage_slope and mileage_intercept: Represent how resale price correlates with mileage. A high positive slope means higher mileage positively impacts resale value, while a negative slope indicates lower resale for higher mileage.

##### **Key Insights from Data:**

* Some brands (like Bajaj and Kawasaki) show negative price slopes, indicating heavy depreciation.
* Certain motorcycles (e.g., Hero, Yamaha) have higher mileage slopes, meaning better mileage contributes positively to resale value.
* Higher mileage_range values are associated with lower depreciation, likely because fuel efficiency is a major selling point.



### 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Which attributes (price, engine capacity, mileage) have the highest impact on resale price?
```sql
SELECT corr("Price (INR)", "Resale Price (INR)") AS price_corr,
       corr("Engine Capacity (cc)", "Resale Price (INR)") AS engine_capacity_corr,
       corr("Mileage (kmpl)", "Resale Price (INR)") AS mileage_corr
FROM motorcycle_sales;
```

The corr(column1, column2) function calculates the correlation coefficient between two numerical columns.

###### **How It Works**

Measures the strength & direction of the relationship between two variables.
Returns a value between -1 and 1:
* 1 ‚Üí Strong positive correlation (as one increases, the other also increases).
* 0 ‚Üí No correlation.
* -1 ‚Üí Strong negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases).

1. 0.905 ‚Üí Strong positive correlation between Price and Resale Price (Higher original price = Higher resale price).
2. 0.003 ‚Üí Almost no correlation between Engine Capacity and Resale Price (Engine size doesn‚Äôt significantly impact resale).
3. 0.007 ‚Üí Almost no correlation between Mileage and Resale Price (Mileage per liter has minimal impact on resale).
