üìå Resale Value & Depreciation Analysis
* 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average depreciation rate for each brand?
* 9Ô∏è‚É£ How does the resale value change based on bike age (Manufacturing Year vs. Resale Price)?
* üîü Which city tier has the lowest resale value compared to the original price?
* 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Does insurance status affect the resale price significantly?
* 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Which bike model retains its value the most over time?

-- * 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the average depreciation rate for each brand?
-- No Need of SUM and over (partition by) it can be soved simply by group by:

```sql
select 
    AVG(100.0 * (1 - (SUM(ms."Resale Price (INR)") / SUM(ms."Price (INR)" )))) over (partition by ms.brand) as depreciation_price, 
    ms.brand 
from motorcycle_sales ms
group by 2
order by 1 desc
```

-- Gives Same result
```sql
select 
    avg(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)" ))) as depreciation_price, 
    ms.brand 
from motorcycle_sales ms

Results look interesting‚Äînotice how the average resale value doesn‚Äôt always decrease with age? 
What factors might be influencing this? Do certain brands hold their value better, or does fuel type impact resale trends?
A possible next step: Partition by brand or fuel type to see if any patterns emerge. What do you think? üéØ

--* üîü Which city tier has the lowest resale value compared to the original price?

```sql
select 
    ms."City Tier" , 
    AVG(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)" ))) as depreciation_price
from motorcycle_sales ms
group by 1
order by 2 asc
```

| City Tier | Avg Depreciation (%) |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Tier 3    | 40.32                |
| Tier 2    | 40.35                |
| Tier 1    | 40.39                |
| Metro     | 40.44                |


--* 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Which bike model retains its value the most over time?

Grouping by brand vs. model. Both are giving the same result. 

This one is my solution.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Check Brand-Level Trends:

Run a brand-only depreciation query to see which brands overall retain value best.
```sql
select 
    ms.model,
    ms.brand, 
    ms."Year of Manufacture",
    AVG(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)" ))) as depreciation_price
from 
    motorcycle_sales ms 
group by 1, 2, 3
order by 4 asc 
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Models That Stand Out:

Filter top-performing models by setting a depreciation threshold (e.g., models with < 40% depreciation).

```sql
SELECT 
    ms.brand, 
    ms.model, 
    AVG(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)"))) AS avg_depreciation,
    STDDEV(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)"))) AS depreciation_variance
FROM motorcycle_sales ms
GROUP BY ms.brand, ms.model
ORDER BY avg_depreciation ASC;
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Standard Deviation to Check Consistency:

If a brand's depreciation variance (STDDEV) is high, that means some models retain value better than others within that brand.
```sql
SELECT ms.brand, 
       AVG(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)"))) AS avg_depreciation,
       STDDEV(100.0 * (1 - (ms."Resale Price (INR)") / (ms."Price (INR)"))) AS depreciation_variance
FROM motorcycle_sales ms
GROUP BY ms.brand
ORDER BY depreciation_variance DESC;
```

1. High **STDDEV** ‚Üí Some models depreciate much faster than others within the same brand.
2. Low **STDDEV** ‚Üí The brand is consistent in value retention.
