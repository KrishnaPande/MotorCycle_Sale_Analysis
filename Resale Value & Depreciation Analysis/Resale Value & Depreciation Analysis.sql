1Ô∏è‚É£ Brand Variations ‚Äì Different brands have different depreciation rates. Some hold value better (e.g., Royal Enfield), while others drop faster.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Market Fluctuations ‚Äì Resale values are affected by market conditions, not just age. A popular model might have a high resale even after years.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Noise ‚Äì Individual resale values may not follow a perfect downward slope. Outliers (rare models, high demand) can distort the trend.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Grouping Needed ‚Äì Instead of looking at each brand separately, try averaging across all brands per year to see an overall trend.
